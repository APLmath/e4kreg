=== E4KReg ===
Authors: Andrew Lee, Lisa Yan

Google Spreadsheets-based registration system for UC Berkeley's "Engineering 4
Kids" outreach program.

== Description ==
E4KReg is a WordPress plugin that interfaces with Google Spreadsheets to provide
a registration system that is easy to administer. From the plugin's admin page,
the administrator enters the registration parameters (such as the important
dates, limits, etc.), and then when people register, the information is added
automatically to the registration Google Spreadsheet. This allows the
administrator to easily view the spreadsheet, and even manually add or delete
registrations as needed.
